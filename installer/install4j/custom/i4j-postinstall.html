DD Poker requires network/internet access to work properly.<BR>
<BR>
If you have internet security software running and are asked whether
DD Poker or ddpoker.exe should be allowed access to the network/internet 
or whether it should be 'unblocked', please answer <B>Yes</B> and pick the 
choice that always allows access (if you have that option).<BR>
<BR>
Thanks and enjoy DD Poker!
